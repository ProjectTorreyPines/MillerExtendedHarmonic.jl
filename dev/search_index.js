The method is based on a systematic expansion in a small number of intuitive shape parameters, and reduces to the well-known Miller D-shaped parameterization in the limit where some of the coefficients are set to zero. The parameterization is valid for up-down asymmetric plasmas and provides an improvement to the Miller form. Simultaneously, the method is rapidly convergent and requires only about half the number of shape parameters as a general Fourier representation in the pedestal.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","title":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","text":"Based on https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1708848","category":"page"},{"location":"#Online-documentation","page":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","title":"Online documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","title":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","text":"For more details, see the online documentation.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","title":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl","text":"(Image: Docs)","category":"page"},{"location":"notice/#MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl-Notice","page":"Notice","title":"MillerExtendedHarmonic.jl Notice","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"notice/","page":"Notice","title":"Notice","text":"The purpose of this NOTICE file is to provide legal notices and acknowledgments that must be displayed to users in any derivative works or distributions.
